#  Quicket Web Application


Creating a program aimed at generating tickets for a concert involves implementing various key functionalities. These include a login system, the ability to process payments for tickets, imposing a time limit to complete the purchase, and notifying the user if tickets are sold out before the set time. Additionally, the program should manage different ticket classes (such as VIP), record the sale date of each ticket, and establish a maximum period of 48 hours for canceling a purchase, with a corresponding refund to the user and recording the cancellation date.

To ensure a fair experience, the system should limit users to a maximum of 5 tickets. Furthermore, there will be a section dedicated to receiving feedback on the ticket generator, aiming to collect input and continuously improve the application. Additionally, a log will be maintained to track user account access.

Given the application's focus on musical events, it will be crucial to have features allowing the addition of different types of artists who will perform, each with a limited number of available tickets. This feature adds an extra element of management and planning to ensure proper distribution of tickets among various artists and event types.
